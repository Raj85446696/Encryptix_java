_Title: Number Guessing Game_

**Overview:**
The Number Guessing Game is a fun and engaging Java application that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. With only three attempts to guess the correct number, players will test their luck and intuition in a race against time.

**Objective:**
The goal of the game is to correctly guess the number within three attempts. Each time the player makes a guess, the program will provide feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

**Game Flow:**

After each guess, the program provides feedback:
If the guess is correct, the player wins.
If the guess is too high or too low, the player is informed and can try again.
If the player fails to guess the number in three attempts, the program reveals the correct number and ends the game.
